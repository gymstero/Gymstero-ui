    "title" : "Barbell Bench Press",
    "description": "The bench press is a classic compound exercise that targets the chest, shoulders, and arms. It works the pectoralis major, anterior deltoid, and triceps brachii while also building the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizer muscles. The movement is simple enough for both beginners and advanced weight trainers to perform, making it a staple in upper-body strength and conditioning programs, as well as rehabilitation programs.",
    "warning":[
      "When lifting heavy weights, avoid arching your back. This indicates that the weight is too heavy and increases the risk of injury.",
      "For added safety when lifting heavy weights, utilize the assistance of a spotter."
    ],
    "instructions":[
      "Lie back on a flat bench and grasp the bar with both hands a little wider than shoulder-width apart, at an even distance from the weight at each end.",
      "Palms should be facing up toward the ceiling.",
      "Take a deep breath in, then, while exhaling, lift the bar from the rack so that arms are fully extended and elbows locked.",
      "On the next breath in, slowly lower the bar toward the chest. Stop just short of touching the chest.",
      "Breathe out and push the weight straight up, away from the chest, returning to full elbow extension."
